    I am currently a Software Engineering Student studying at the University of
    Auckland based in New Zealand. I am passionate about software development
    and always looking to learn more and improve my skillset. I enjoy developing
    all sorts of technologies and applications to solve problems and create
    products. I want to be working in a role where I know I am going to be
    challenged and learning every day, allowing for my ambition to drive
    innovative ideas.
